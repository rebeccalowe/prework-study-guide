# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This prework study guide was created to assist bootcamp students with the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If students run into issues while coding, they can refer to this study guide to remember useful information about each language. As a new bootcamp student, this prework study guide allowed me to get into the habit of coding and understanding the fundamentals of all 3 languages before class begins.
